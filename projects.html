    <h2>
        data comparison using python<br>
    </h2>
    <p1>
        &nbspWhile working for the City of Lawrence, I found an interesting project that I could impliment using Lansweeper and python.
    </p1>
    <h2>
        &nbsp&nbsp the problem<br>
    </h2>
    <p1>
        &nbsp&nbsp The city had no accurate way of determining whether users with Microsoft 365 access were using the correct version of Microsoft office.
    </p1>
    <h2>
        &nbsp&nbsp breaking the problem down<br>
    </h2>
    <p1>
        I found that you can export data out of Lansweeper, and through that, 
        I retrieved ".csv" files of all the employees of the city that used Outlook 2016.
        In addition to that data, I retrieved all of the users that had a "G3" license, which
        allows the user to use the latest Microsoft digital products.
        <br><br>
        I then used python to create a 'User' class containing all relevent information (Username, Display Names, email, etc...)
        <br><br>
        I also added a limits to the results, for more accurate reporting.
        <br><br>
        For example, a theoretical user could have used a computer that was decommisioned, even though they have
        the upgraded license.
        <br><br>
        To account for this, I looked at the time of the last login of each computer with the outdated Office product,
        disqualifying it if it has not been scanned by Lansweeper in the last month. (If it hasn't been scanned, then it must be offline)
